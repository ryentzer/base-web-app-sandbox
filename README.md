Minimum setup to test web app ideas and functionality

This is the minimum setup that I use for the company I work for when I need to test/research a specific feature for the web apps that we currently build.

Current stack includes the following:

+ Grunt 1.0.1
+ jQuery 3.2.1
+ Sass 2.0
+ Bootstrap 3.3.7
